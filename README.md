<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Word Summit: The Project
_An App by The Crunglers_

This app is very fun and easy to install. If it doesn't work, that's on you.

Here's why:
* It's a simple APK file in the root directory
* It's foolproof
* Targets API 32, goes as low as 27
* Just do it

Your mom enjoyed the app.

Launch the `Word_Summit.apk` in your Android Emulator (or ADB sideload it if you're a nerd) to get started.

### Built With

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/)
* [Volley](https://google.github.io/volley/)
* [DataMuse](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It's really easy.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
  ```sh
  sudo mom-install
  ```
  
  (This won't work. Don't do it.)

### Installation

1. Go to Android Emulator
2. Drag and drop Word_Summit.apk onto the Emulator window
3. ???
4. Profit

## Known Issues

There's a lot. DataMuse API is kind of bad. A lot of words that should work don't. It's not fully fleshed out but it's coming along.
