<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Word Summit: The Project
_An App by The Crunglers_

This app is very fun and easy to install. If it doesn't work, that's on you.

Here's why:
* It's a simple APK file in the root directory
* It's foolproof
* Targets API 32, goes as low as 27
* Just do it

Your mom enjoyed the app.

Launch the `Word_Summit.apk` in your Android Emulator (or ADB sideload it if you're a nerd) to get started.
