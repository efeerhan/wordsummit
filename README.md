<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Word Summit: The Project
_An App by The Crunglers_

Welcome to Word Summit! The game about testing your knowledge on homophones and synonyms! This app was built in under 24 hours as part of the 2022 Mountain Madness Hackathon at Simon Fraser University, and won 1 of 4 prizes!

### Built With

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/)
* [Volley](https://google.github.io/volley/)
* [DataMuse](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It's really simple! The installation file is a single APK file in the repo's root directory.

### Prerequisites
* Targets API 32, goes as low as 27

### Installation

Launch the `Word_Summit.apk` in your Android Emulator, or ADB sideload it to get started.

## Known Issues

There's a lot. DataMuse API is kind of bad. A lot of words that should work don't. It's not fully fleshed out but it's coming along.
